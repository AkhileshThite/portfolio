      Hey!ðŸ‘‹ I am Akhilesh. I'm a second-year undergraduate student from the Department of Computer Science Engineering
      at Terna Engineering College, University of Mumbai.

    <p>
      I find programming and mathematics very interesting as they are one of the best means to exercise the
      brain. I am proficient in Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science, I enjoy the process of
      converting data into actionable insights. Using these skills I would love to work in the field of science to make
      a good change in everyone's lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love open-source because it allows you to collaborate with everyone and harness a global network of
      creative, intelligent, and knowledgeable individuals.

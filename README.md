## Step 1: Getting the source

Click on code and download the latest source. Extract the archive and rename the folder portfolio-main to portfolio.

## Step 2: Run a webserver

Open the terminal

Navigate to the dogecoin folder you just created and run this command: python -m SimpleHTTPServer

If you have python 3 installed you can run the webserver with the following command: python3 -m http.server

Step 3: Happy Coding :)

Now you have a working copy of my portfolio at http://localhost:8000.
